interface AppState {
  jobs: Job[];
  resumes: Resume[];
  evaluations: Evaluation[];
  filters: FilterState;
  searchQuery: string;
  selectedItems: SelectedState;
  user: UserState;
}

// Use React Context or Redux Toolkit for state management
```

## ðŸ“Š Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:

- Backend: API endpoint tests, evaluation engine tests
- Frontend: Component tests, utility function tests

- End-to-end workflow tests (job creation â†’ resume upload â†’ evaluation)
- API integration tests
- Database operation tests

### User Acceptance Tests:

- Placement team workflow simulation
- Student portal functionality
- Performance and load testing

## ðŸš€ Deployment & DevOps

### Production Readiness:

```yaml
# Docker configuration for deployment
# Environment variable management
# Database migration strategy
# Monitoring and logging setup
# Backup and recovery procedures
```

### Performance Optimization:

```python
# Backend optimizations:
- Database connection pooling
- Response caching for static data
- Background job processing for bulk operations
- File storage optimization (AWS S3/MinIO)

# Frontend optimizations:
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization and compression
- CDN integration for static assets
- Service worker for offline functionality
```
