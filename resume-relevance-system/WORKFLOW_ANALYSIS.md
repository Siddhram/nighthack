# Resume Relevance System: Current vs Desired Workflow Analysis

## 🔍 Current System Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)

**Structure:**

- **FastAPI Application**: Multi-router architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite, three main entities (Jobs, Resumes, Evaluations)
- **Services**: Modular services for resume parsing, evaluation engine, and Pinecone/Gemini integration
- **Routers**: RESTful APIs for jobs, resumes, evaluations, and dashboard

**Key Components:**

1. **Job Management** (`/api/jobs/`)

   - ✅ Create/Read/Update/Delete job postings
   - ✅ Store required/preferred skills, qualifications, experience
   - ✅ Company, location, description fields

2. **Resume Management** (`/api/resumes/`)

   - ✅ PDF/DOCX upload with file validation
   - ✅ Resume parsing with skill extraction
   - ✅ Candidate information storage (name, email, phone)

3. **Evaluation Engine** (`/api/evaluations/`)

   - ✅ Hybrid scoring (Hard Match + Semantic Match)
   - ✅ Skill matching with fuzzy logic
   - ✅ TF-IDF and Sentence Transformers for semantic analysis
   - ✅ Weighted scoring formula (70% required, 30% preferred skills)
   - ✅ Suitability classification (High/Medium/Low)

4. **Dashboard** (`/api/dashboard/`)
   - ✅ Statistics aggregation
   - ✅ Evaluation summaries by suitability

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

**Structure:**

- **React Router**: Navigation between Dashboard, Jobs, Resumes, Evaluations
- **Component Architecture**: Layout wrapper with page-specific components
- **State Management**: Local state with React hooks
- **API Integration**: Axios-based service layer

**Current Pages:**

1. **Dashboard**: ✅ Statistics display with charts and metrics
2. **Jobs**: ✅ Basic job listing (Add Job UI missing)
3. **Resumes**: ❌ Placeholder only - needs implementation
4. **Evaluations**: ❌ Placeholder only - needs implementation
5. **UploadResume**: ✅ File upload interface

## 🎯 Desired Placement Team Workflow

### Required Workflow Steps:

1. **Job Requirement Upload** 📋

   - Placement team uploads job description (JD)
   - Extract role title, must-have skills, good-to-have skills, qualifications

2. **Resume Upload** 📄

   - Students upload resumes while applying
   - Support PDF/DOCX formats

3. **Resume Parsing** 🔧

   - Extract raw text from PDF/DOCX
   - Standardize formats (remove headers/footers, normalize sections)

4. **JD Parsing** 📝

   - Extract role title, must-have skills, good-to-have skills, qualifications

5. **Relevance Analysis** 🧠

   - **Step 1**: Hard Match – keyword & skill check (exact and fuzzy matches)
   - **Step 2**: Semantic Match – embedding similarity using LLMs
   - **Step 3**: Scoring & Verdict – weighted scoring for final score

6. **Output Generation** 📊

   - Relevance Score (0–100)
   - Missing Skills/Projects/Certifications
   - Verdict (High/Medium/Low suitability)
   - Suggestions for student improvement

7. **Storage & Access** 💾

   - Results stored in database
   - Search/filter resumes by job role, score, location

8. **Web Application** 🖥️
   - Placement team dashboard: upload JD, see shortlisted resumes
